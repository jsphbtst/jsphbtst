### Joseph J. Bautista

Software engineer by day, crappy robotics and software builder by night.

Idk... I like looking at things one level of abstraction deeper at a time. Though I do build and manage large and complex codebases in my professional career, I tend to like working on bits and pieces of software in my free time. I like isolating certain features or characteristics I'm particularly interested in at the moment. I believe it's the amalgamation of these little eureka moments that eventually transform you into a better engineerâ€”the spirit of tinkering, goofing off, and just playing around. Well, one of the ways.

C will always be my first love, though I've had some recent musings with Go. Professionally, I use JavaScript/Typescript, Python, and Ruby.

Wanna chat or connect? Shoot me an email at joseph.bautista@proton.me. Would love to connect with y'alls.

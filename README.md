### Joseph J. Bautista

Software engineer by day, crappy robotics and software builder by night.

Idk... I like looking at things one level of abstraction deeper at a time. Though I do build and manage large and complex codebases in my professional career, I tend to like working on bits and pieces of software in my free time. I like isolating certain features or characteristics I'm particularly interested in at the moment. I believe it's the amalgamation of these little eureka moments that eventually transform you into a better engineerâ€”the spirit of tinkering, goofing off, and just playing around. Well, one of the ways.

C will always be my first love, but in order to make a living, I use JavaScript/Typescript, Python, Ruby, and Go.

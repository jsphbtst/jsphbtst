Principal software engineer by day, crappy robotics and software builder by night.

I'm just the dude that likes looking at things one level of abstraction deeper at a time. Though I do build and manage large and complex codebases in my professional line of work, I tend to like working on bits and pieces of software in my free time to isolate certain features or characteristics of the language I'm working with.

C will always be my first love (a lot of my personal projects are usually built in C), though I've had some recent musings with Go. Professionally, I use JavaScript/Typescript, Python, and Ruby.

Wanna chat or connect? Shoot me an email at joseph.bautista@proton.me. Would love to connect with y'alls.
